# MAESTRO 2: The Agentic Engineering Core

Maestro 2 is a systemic software development framework designed for high-integrity, AI-orchestrated projects. 
It enforces the **8-Layer Supreme Architecture** (RFC, Contract, Simulation, Red-Team, etc.) and provides a fractal domain structure.

## Features
- **Fractal Colocation**: Docs, Tests, and Code live together.
- **Maestro-Prime Skill**: Professional AI orchestration protocols.
- **Red Team First**: Mandatory adversarial testing templates.
- **Simulation Oracles**: Virtual-time system verification.

## Setup
1. Copy `.system/` and `docs/system/` to your project.
2. Initialize your domains in `maestro.json` (Coming Soon).
3. Let the Agent guide you through the 8 layers.
