# FORGE: Ideate - Interactive Feature Definition

## Feature Idea: $ARGUMENTS

Transform a rough idea into a clear, well-defined feature brief through interactive questioning. Creates a living IDEATION.md document that solidifies what the feature IS and IS NOT.

---

## Why This Step Exists

Before research (Find), we need clarity. This step:
- Extracts the core intent from rough/rambling input
- Asks targeted questions to fill gaps
- Defines boundaries (in-scope vs out-of-scope)
- Creates a reference document for all subsequent FORGE steps

### 1.2 Create Feature Folder

```bash
# Convert to kebab-case folder name
# e.g., "user authentication with OAuth" → "user-auth-oauth"

### What It Is NOT
- {Top 3 out-of-scope items}

### Success Criteria
- {Top 2-3 criteria}

### Open Questions for Research

---

### Next Step

```bash
/forge:find FORGE/{feature-name}/
```

The idea is now solidified. Find will research the implementation.
```

---

## Key Principles

1. **Always show progress** - After each round, display what's been captured
2. **Live document** - IDEATION.md updates in real-time, not just at the end
3. **Trailing summaries** - Each round ends with a summary of current state
4. **Explicit boundaries** - Always capture both IS and IS NOT
5. **Confirm before proceeding** - Final review ensures alignment
6. **Prepare for Find** - Open questions become research targets

---

## Integration with Find

When `/forge:find` is run on a folder with IDEATION.md:

1. Find reads IDEATION.md first
2. Research agents receive the defined scope
3. Agents focus on "in-scope" items
4. Agents explicitly avoid "out-of-scope" items
5. Open questions become research priorities

This ensures focused, targeted research instead of broad exploration.
