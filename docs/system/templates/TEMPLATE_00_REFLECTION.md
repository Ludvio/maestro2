# Phase [XX] Systemic Reflection: [Name]

> **Purpose**: To force "System 2" thinking. Before generating the "What" (Code/Milestones), we must analyze the "Why" and the "Risk".
> **Constraint**: This is internal context for the AI, used to populate the `reflectionNotes` in the orchestrator state.

## 1. Architectural Integrity (The Sync)
*   **Question**: How does this phase affect the `Grodzisko` core state?
*   **Risk**: Does adding `X` create a synchronization bottleneck or a merge conflict nightmare for local-first?
*   **Mitigation Strategy**: [Describe the technical guardrail].

## 2. Constitutional Alignment (The Soul)
*   **Article Review**: Does this feature drift toward a "Transactional" model (Prices, Fees, Markets)?
*   **Tension**: Is there a conflict between "Convenience" and "Resilience" (e.g., using a Cloud API)?
*   **Resolution**: [How we stay Lechite].

## 3. The "Frankenstein" Test (The Structure)
*   **Question**: Are we creating a new pattern or reusing an existing store/component?
*   **Decision**: [Reuse vs New Pattern justification].

## 4. Adversarial Intent (The Breach)
*   **Scenario**: If I am a malicious user, how do I exploit this feature to drain resources or spam the community?
*   **Defense**: [Describe the Red Team focus for Layer F].
