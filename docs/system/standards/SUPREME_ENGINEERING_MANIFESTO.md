/**
 * Description: SUPREME ENGINEERING STANDARD (Manifesto)
 * Concept: "Anthropic Style" Constitutional Engineering.
 * 
 * --- CORE PHILOSOPHY ---
 * We do not write software; we discover durable digital physics.
 * Every Phase is a Hypothesis. Every Judge is a Prosecutor.
 * 
 * --- THE 8 LAYERS OF SUPREME ARCHITECTURE ---
 * 
 * Layer D (Document): The Constitution (RFC). Defines Invariants.
 * Layer E (Economy): The Contract (API). Defines Interfaces.
 * Layer I (Implementation): The Machine (Store). Executes Logic.
 * Layer S (Simulation): The Happy Path. Verifies Function.
 * Layer U (UI): The Interface. Human-Readable State.
 * Layer G (Governance): The Judge. Bureaucratic Compliance.
 * Layer P (Proof): The Evidence. E2E Verification.
 * Layer F (Fuzzer): The Adversary. Constitutional Stress Test.
 * 
 * --- RECURSIVE IMPROVEMENT LOOP ---
 * 1. Human writes Layer D (Constitution).
 * 2. Human writes Layer I (Implementation).
 * 3. System runs Layer F (Fuzzer) against Layer D's rules.
 * 4. If Fuzzer finds a crack -> Update Layer I (Patch).
 * 5. If Fuzzer finds ambiguity -> Update Layer D (Clarify).
 * 6. Repeat until System is Sovereign.
